                    Hi there, my name is Levan! Journalist, Developer, and Musician from Brooklyn, New York. I love working on details and putting everything in order... i assume it is obvious based on things i chose to do in my life. love to make things coherent and simple. Originally from Tbilisi, Georgia moved to new york in 2022 for new challenges.
